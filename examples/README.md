# Examples

Each example contains a `handler.js` file.

To run them, you first need to install the dependencies in this directory:

```console
npm i
```

Then you can run examples with:

```console
node <example_name>/handler.js
```

For example:

```console
# Run object example locally
node with_object/handler.js

# Make request (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:8080
```
