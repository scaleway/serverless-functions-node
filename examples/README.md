# Examples

To run the examples, you first need to install the examples dependencies:

```console
npm i
```

You can then run each example with:

```console
node <example_name>/handler.js
```

For example:

```console
# Run object example locally
node with_object/handler.js

# Make request (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:8080
```
